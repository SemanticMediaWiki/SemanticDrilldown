# About

Fork of MediaWiki extension SemanticDrilldown that aims to simplify contribution through hosting on GitHub instead of Gerrit, improved quality through better test coverage and continuous integration. 

Semantic Drilldown is an extension to MediaWiki that works in conjunction with another extension, Semantic MediaWiki, to provide a drilldown interface for all the data on a site.

For more information on Semantic Drilldown, see the extension homepage at:
