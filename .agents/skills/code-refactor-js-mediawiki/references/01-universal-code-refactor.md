**Procedure — code:refactor**

1.  Run the full test suite first. All tests must be green before you
    start.

2.  Check test coverage for the files you intend to change. If coverage
    is below ~80% on the affected code paths, warn explicitly before
    proceeding: low coverage means the refactoring cannot be verified
    safely. Do not block, but make the risk visible.

3.  Make structural changes (extract method, rename, move class, etc.).

4.  Run the full test suite again. All tests must still be green.

5.  If a test breaks, you changed behavior — revert the change or
    explicitly justify updating the test.

6.  Never change test logic during a refactor unless the test itself was
    wrong.
